# python-challenge
This is a challenge where we are expected to do some calculations using python. 
Unfortunately fo me, my python and juypter could'nt import the csv file, it was showing error.
I went on google and youtube to find solution to that problem, but still could'nt solve it.
I tried the AskBcs,but it says they're temporarily unavailable throughout the whole day.
I don't really have much knowledge about panda,but i tried using it to solve it. not sure if its right
Today i spent almost 20hrs on this challenge but still could not solve the problem that i had.
I thought submitting this would be etter than not submitting anything. 
I'm not sure if this is right,just need to explain myself please.
